# Overview  
A simple agent chat prototype that allows users to interact with a locally hosted Gemma 27B LLM via a FastAPI backend and LangChain integration. The system enables users to send questions and receive answers from the model, supporting rapid prototyping and local inference for advanced LLM workflows. Target users are developers and researchers who want to experiment with large language models locally, without relying on cloud APIs.

# Core Features  
- Local inference with Gemma 27B (no cloud dependency)
- FastAPI backend with a /chat endpoint
- LangChain integration for prompt management and extensibility
- Simple JSON API for chat (POST {"message": ...})
- (Optional) Simple web UI or Swagger UI for testing
- (Optional) Conversation history/context management

# User Experience  
- User sends a message via API or web UI
- System returns a response from Gemma 27B
- (Optional) User can view previous messages in a session
- Designed for fast iteration and local experimentation

# Technical Architecture  
- Components:
  - FastAPI server (Python)
  - LangChain LLM wrapper for Gemma
  - Model loader using HuggingFace Transformers (or Gemma-specific loader)
  - (Optional) Simple frontend (HTML/JS or Swagger UI)
- Data models:
  - ChatRequest: { message: str }
  - ChatResponse: { response: str }
- APIs:
  - POST /chat: Accepts a message, returns model response
- Infrastructure:
  - Local machine with sufficient RAM/VRAM for Gemma 27B
  - Python 3.10+, pip/venv

# Development Roadmap  
- Phase 1 (MVP):
  - Project scaffolding and environment setup
  - Implement model loader for Gemma 27B
  - Create LangChain LLM wrapper and chain
  - Build FastAPI backend with /chat endpoint
  - Test with Swagger UI and curl
- Phase 2 (Enhancements):
  - Add conversation history/context
  - Add simple web UI
  - Add authentication and logging
  - Optimize inference (quantization, batching, streaming)

# Logical Dependency Chain
- Set up Python environment and dependencies
- Download and verify Gemma 27B model
- Implement model loader and test local inference
- Integrate with LangChain (LLM wrapper, chain)
- Build FastAPI backend and /chat endpoint
- Test end-to-end chat flow
- (Optional) Add frontend, context, and enhancements

# Risks and Mitigations  
- Model size/resource requirements: Use quantized models or smaller variants if needed
- Inference latency: Optimize with batching/streaming, or use smaller models for dev
- Integration issues: Start with minimal working example, add complexity incrementally
- Security: Restrict API to localhost, add auth if exposing externally
